nature of authorisations, maintenance of records and adequate disposal mechanisms.
Over 377 million urban people live in 7,935 towns and cities and generate 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per annum.
Only 43 million tonnes (MT) of the waste is collected, 11.9 MT is treated and 31 MT is dumped in landfill sites.
key to efficient waste management 
	1.waste at source and to ensure that the waste goes through different streams of 	recycling and resource recovery.
	2.reduced final residue
	3.sanitary landfill
	4.inorganic and organic waste
	5.Major limitation of this method is the costly transportation of MSW to far away 	landfill sites.
	6. 500,000 rag-pickers employment
	7.participation from non-profits or community is limited
	8. informal recycling industry 
	9. three-fourth of solid waste management budget is allotted to collection and 	transportation, leaving leaves very little for processing or resource recovery and 	disposal. 
	10. segregate biodegradable waste -- Bio-methanation 
	11.E-waste components
	12.The concept of common waste treatment facility (ENVIS Newsletter, December 		2010) is being widely promoted and accepted as it uses waste as a resource by either 	using it as a co-fuel or co-raw material in manufacturing processes. -- industrial use
	13. Public Private Partnership (PPP) models 
14.Bio-medical waste (management and handling) rules, 1998 prescribe that there should be a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) at every 150 kms in the country. CBWTFs have been set up and are functioning in cities and towns. However, establishment of functional CBWTF throughout the country must be ensured
	15.indicators and metrics to track progress
	16.Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) approach

Categorization and Sorting for Waste Management
1-The success of the waste management policy is based on good sorting practice by the largest number of citizen
.
2-The users have to learn and respect the categorization of waste defined by the managers. The national average is 17% of collections which are refused entry sorting centers due to poor sorting. 

3-Sorting instructions differ in fact several categories of waste. There are specific waste bin each color. The user of the collection service has to learn the rules established by the local authority and to endorse.

4- Besides the sorting of glass and optionally organic waste, the individual must create two categories of waste including those he throws among the garbage and those that throw from the collection. To do this, the individual goes through a categorization process. 

5-The categorization simplifies the environment by making them more easily and quickly stimuli understandable and manageable [5]. She quickly identifies the new elements in treating them as objects already known and that the individual judge as similar [6]

Brief Description of the Functional Units:-

1- if you’re tired of seeing garbage piling up on your street, all you have to do is click a picture and post it to the web-app.so that the non-government organizations and other people can join hands for a cleanliness drive.

2- When it comes to cleaning up your house, you can sell all kinds of recyclable materials (like newspapers) and non-biodegradable plastic, and get rid of old useless phones, all through the click of a button.

3- You can sell anything that is even remotely recyclable through this web app  and set a price per kilogram for it. Set up a request, and a team from vendor  will come to collect it, and weigh the trash using an electronic scale. They’ll pay on the spot, and you never have to hoard waste again. They send off the waste to industries that collect such waste to recycle and reuse. 

4- Schedule an e-waste pick-up with the web app, if you are not sure what you want to do with your old laptops or phones,the web app that is aimed at sustainably managing the rising e-waste problem in the city. Out of a study that the team conducted, it emerged that most citizens were unaware about how to deal with electronic waste such as phones or batteries, while some found the lack of e-waste collection systems a hindrance. The app raises awareness about e-waste services, while also educating users about the dangers of neglecting e-waste.


5- The app has a free doorstep service in select areas of the city. Their vehicle travels around these areas collecting scrap and waste. You have to pre-book the service, and select a time from the available slots.
